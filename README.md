Flagship is a render manager designed to handle After effects and Blender projects.
The main goal of flagship is to seamlessly integrate into existing software providing a very user friendly way to distribute render processing across many machines.

To do this I wrote plugins for AE and blender, which once installed provide a network render interface, through which an artist can easily submit render jobs to the server and then view progress through a WebUI.
